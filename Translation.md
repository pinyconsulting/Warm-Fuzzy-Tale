### Warm Fuzzy Tale 温暖的绒绒 ###

Once upon a time there was a land where everyone was very happy. Each person was born with a magic bag which contained an endless supply of warm fuzzies. When these were handed out to other people, they were like the touch of a small child’s hand - so that people felt warmth and caring whenever they received a fuzzy. And because the bags were magic, everyone could ask for and get as many warm fuzzies as they wanted.

从前有一个地方，在那儿大家都很快乐。每个人出生的时候就有一个神奇的袋子，里面有取之不尽的「温暖的绒绒」。当这些「绒绒」给到人的时候，它们就像小孩子的手的抚摸那样，接到它的人会觉得很温暖，很受关爱。因为袋子是神奇的，人人都可以要，也可以因而得到他们想要的、足够多的「温暖的绒绒」。

One day a wicked witch arrived and started a rumour that there would not always be enough fuzzies in the bags. (The witch wanted to sell potions that bring happiness so the free fuzzy supplies were very bad for business.) People started to hold their fuzzies back in case the rumour was true, so just as in the financial markets they ended up causing it to become true.

有一天来了一个邪恶的巫婆，她开始散布一种说法，“袋子里不会总是有足够的「绒绒」的！”（巫婆想要卖她的可以带来幸福快乐的神奇药水，所以呢，要是袋子里有取之不尽的「温暖的绒绒」，这太影响生意了。）有人想到，这个说法可能是真的喔，所以他们开始犹豫，不愿给出「绒绒」了，慢慢地，就像是在交易市场那样，「绒绒」看起来真的变得不是取之不尽的了。

Now the land was not so happy. People gave out fuzzies only sparingly, and even then they wanted one in return each time. Someone invented cold pricklies, which stimulated unpleasant feelings but at least reminded people that they were alive. The wicked witch made a lot of money selling misery cures.

现在这个地方，大家没那么快乐了。人们都不太愿意给出「绒绒」，有时候给出一个还盼着换回一个。有人发明了「冷冷的刺刺」，它会带来不愉快的感觉，但至少可以提醒人，“你还活着！” 那个邪恶的巫婆得逞了，她通过兜售治愈痛苦的神奇药水，赚了很多钱。

A group of people got together and invented plastic fuzzies, where it felt for a moment as if a warm fuzzy had been received but then it became apparent that there was no real feeling behind it from the giver.

还有一群人一起发明了仿造的「戎戎」, 一拿到它的时候很像「绒绒」的感觉，但很快就可以发现，给出它的人并没有带着真实的情感。

Eventually a wise traveller came along, saw what had happened and told people that the bags WERE magic and that the more warm fuzzies they gave out, the more would be generated. Some people started to believe the traveller and began to give out more fuzzies. We are now waiting to see them succeed in changing the fuzzy-giving pattern for the better.

后来，一个有智慧的旅行者来到这个地方，看到这儿发生了什么，告诉大家，袋子是真的有魔力的，给出的「温暖的绒绒」越多，就可以有更多。人们开始相信这位旅行者说的，更多地给出「绒绒」！我们对他们调整给出「绒绒」的模式<sup>1</sup>，成功地变得更快乐，充满期待。
